///- Write some code to allow a user to configure a building.
  - Create a new flat
  - Register a new tenant
  - Add a tenant to a flat.
- Don't worry about saving it to a file for now, that's too complex. 
- Don't forget to check things; you shouldn't allow 100 people to move in to a 2 bedroom flat...

- Sometimes flats aren't available to rent because they're being renovated. 
  - They shouldn't have any occupants, but they're not vacant, and shouldn't 
    let people move in.
  - Update the management program so it can mark flats as undergoing renovation.
  - And update the other areas of your program so people can't move in. 

- Write some utility methods that help the landlord manage the entire building.
  - Evict everyone in the building in one go. 
  - List the names of all tenants. 
  - Display the number of occupied & vacant flats. 
  - Display the total rental income of the building. 

- Allow the landlord to manage multiple buildings. 
  - You'll need something to store your multiple buildings...
    - Maybe an array? Maybe a hash? 
  - And you'll need to let the user decide which building to work with. 
    - And probably store that as 'current building' somewhere.

What do I want to create?

Menu funtion which allows the user to input information and create new objects (new apartments, new clients) and also add/remove clients (tenants) to an apartment.

Create Menu (see ruby calculator) giving the option to (1) Create a new Client file (2) Add a appt instruction (3) add tenant to appt

Create a class for each "class". 
        appt class


How?  Create def menu
          create "when" to link user choice in menu to correct class
                capture user input (gets.chomp, to_i, number_input, text_input)
                      create [] empty array to store user input
                            store user inout in programme (locally, ie if the programme is quit then info is lost *use JSON if I have time*)


              CLASS'S AND THEIR INSTANCE METHODS

              CREATE NEW CLIENT - Client name, Client Age, Client gender

              ADD NEW APPT - Appt name, bedrooms, bathrooms, sq ft

              ADD TENANT TO FLAT - Move client array info into appt (<< like in the lesson)
